The data set "Plant specimens from the Botanical Garden Berlin" is a valuable collection obtained from the NFDI 3D hackathon. It consists of approximately 67,000 rows and four columns containing essential information.

The first column provides links to the plant specimens, allowing users to access detailed information and images. The second column contains the names of the recorded plants, providing botanical identification. The third column specifies the names of the individuals responsible for recording the specimens. Finally, the fourth column sporadically includes the Wikidata links of the respective persons, offering additional context and background information.

The herbarium of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin, established in 1819, stands as the largest herbarium in Germany, housing an impressive collection of 3.6 million dried and preserved plant specimens. In an effort to enhance accessibility, the herbarium has been digitizing its specimens since 2000, making them available on the Internet. Presently, around 200,000 records are digitally accessible through the web, providing researchers and enthusiasts with a wealth of botanical knowledge and resources.
