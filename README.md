## Quarto and Jupyter Notebook

The main publishing workflow uses Quarto to render the output of Jupyter Notebook files. Run the .ipynb files in JupyterLab or Visual Studio Code or any other Jupyter environment and then run:

`quarto render`

for Quarto to render the output into an output directory, in this case, ./docs. 

GitHub Pages then serves the HTML files in the ./docs directory as a website.
